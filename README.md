WarGame Scala
=============

This is a kinda-sorta benchmark in the [Scala language](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

You can read more about the [WarGame](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks/wargame) and its existing implementations.

**Notice:** WarGame Scala is a work progress. It is in development, and may not be completed, or as performant as other versions of WarGame.
